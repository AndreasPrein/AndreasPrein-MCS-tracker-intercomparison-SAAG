    "This is a working example of an MCS feature tracking algorithm that uses hourly precipitation and brithness temperature data to classify MCSs. Earlier versions of this tracking algorithm have been used in [Poujol et al. (2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-020-05466-1) and [Prein et al. (2021) ](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2019.0546).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tracking algorithm contains three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Create a mask array containing zeros (no object) and ones (object) by thresholding the precipitation and brightness temperature field (Tb) field.\n",
    "*   Identify connected features in the masked field and label them with a unique index. Grid cells are connected if they are adjacent in space and time (diagonal connections are allowed). \n",
    "*   Analyze each identified feateture if it fulfills the minimum requirements for MCSs that are provided by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mimimum requirements are associated with a minimum threshold that the feature must exceed (e.g., 2 mm/h precipitation rates), minimal maximum values (e.g. peak hourly rain rates), minimum size of the object, and a minimum duration for which the maximum value and object size must be exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current example uses [GPM-IMERG v6](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/imerg) precipitation and [MERGIR](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPM_MERGIR_1/summary) Tb observations for MCS tracking for June 1, 2016 over the Contigeous United States. Both datasets are averaged to hourly values (24-time slizes) and the 4 km MERGIR data is regridded to the GPM-IMERG grid. The resulting data is stored in the \"DATA_all\" numpy array which has the dimensions [time, latitude, longitude, variables]. This array is passed to the \"MCStracking\" function, which performs the tracking. A few example outputs from this function are visualized at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"DATA_all\" function returns a directory and a matrix and writes a netcdf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The \"grMCSs\" directory contains sub-directories for each MCS that was identified. Each of the sub-directories contains MCS characteristics such as the track, speed, or max. precipitation. We plot the statistics of this directory at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "*   The \"MCS_obj\" variable is a nupy array that conains the labels of tracked MCSs. Each MCS has a unique index and non-MCS areas are set to zero. The dimensions of \"MCS_obj\" are [time, lat, lon]. This variable can also be found in the NetCDF file that is described below. \n",
    "*   The \"20160701_CONUS-MCS-tracking.nc\" file contains the original precipitation and Tb data that was used for the MCS detection and the labels of each feature that was identified. This file will give you a good overview how the MCSs look like and you can use its content if you would like to perform you own statistics on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If users whant to use a different dataset for MCS tracking (e.g., model results) they have to read in and process the precipitation data into the same format as the \"DATA_all\" data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please send questions or comments concerning this code to Andreas Prein (prein@ucar.edu).\n",
